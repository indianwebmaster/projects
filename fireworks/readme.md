Show a plane move across with a banner with text, on top of a canvas of fireworks.

This page was inspired by a question posted on StackOverflow
  https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/64176/celebratory-fireworks-animation
  
I identified the variable attributes, made some of them random and allowed the canvas to be placed as a page background.
