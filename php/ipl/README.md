This project was meant to manage the IPL YaMaVi league. For 3 years, I used Google Spreadsheets to maintain it. Starting this project, with the intention of using this starting 2020. Plan to test drive it for IPL2019 and WorldCup2019.

## 1.1 Inputs
- Teams (Name, Short name, Captain)
- Users (Name)
- Games (Game Date, Home team, Away team)

## 1.2 Goals
- Allow legitimate bets to be placed for a game for a user
- Show game details, bets placed on the game and winners of a game
- Allow bets to be replaced

## 1.3 Future plans
